# KustomBot
A customizable bot for Twitch.  

This is just a simple project I made for a friend.  
Use https://twitchapps.com/tmi to get your authentication token. 

This bot is very simple but you can program it to do anything you want!  
The example folder provides a simple example for you to get started but you can do much more!  

I am releasing this project to the public hoping it will be helpful for beginners trying to learn JavaScript.  

Check my friend's Twitch channel: [twitch.tv/gwardo420](https://www.twitch.tv/gwardo420)
